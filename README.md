# React + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and includes some ESLint rules for code quality.

## Official Plugins

The template supports two official plugins:

1. **@vitejs/plugin-react:** This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh. For more details, check out the [plugin-react README](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md).

2. **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc:** This alternative plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh. For more details, refer to the [plugin-react-swc README](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc).
